# juliashud

julia's hud is a custom heads-up display for team fortress 2, with the intent to be as simple as possible while still providing adequate information to the user. 
the font noto sans is used for its unicode support as well as just plain looking nice 

if you see anything missing or broken, please let me know! 

shoutouts to all the lovely people at teamfortress.tv and huds.tf for inspiring me to make my own hud and for helping me along the way <3
